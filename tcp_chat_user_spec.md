# TCP Chat Client

Pretty straightforward.

Users will either run 
`node tcp_chat_client.js`
or
`telnet 127.0.0.1 3000`
(until hosted online)

to attach to the server.

There, the user is assinged a user number,
shown the chat history for this server run, and 
then may chat...

`any message` 
will be broadcast to the other users who are logged on.

The command

`/exit`
disconnects the user from the server.

Done.
